# Lab 4, Link with Anchor elements

### Article Section

You can use `a` (anchor) tag to link to content outside of your web page.

The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

The `<a>` tag needs a `href` attribute which indicates the link's destination. It also needs an anchor text.

Here's an example:

```
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>
```

Then your browser will display the text "Visit W3Schools.com!" as a link you can click.

### DIY Section

- Your `<a>` element should have the innner text as "cat photos"
- Your `<a>` element should have href attribute that links to `https://freecatphotoapp.com`
- Your `<a>` element should have a closing tag
